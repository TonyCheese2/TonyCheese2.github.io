                    My name is Jonas Mitrousis, I went to Fairport High School in Rochester NY. I am currently a first year Software Engineering major at Rochester Institute of Technology.
                    Some of my hobbies include listening to music, skiing, and playing video games. Some of my favorite foods include spaghetti, lasagna, smoked brisket, and baklava.
